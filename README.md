# Post Bloc App

This application fetches posts from [JSONPlaceholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com) and display in a long scrolling list.

It follows the BLoC architecture, which is officially recommended for writing Flutter applications.

This project's aim is to allow me to:
- Revisit Flutter dev
- Learn about BLoC hands on
- Implement localization using intl
- Write test cases that aims for 100% code coverage, also integrates with coveralls
- Refresh myself on CI/CD for Flutter
- Run tests and build artifacts on Travis CI
